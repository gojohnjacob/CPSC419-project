# CPSC 419 Final Project: Revamping the CPSC490 Website

## Group 3: Alec Buffi, Bryton Foster, Ellen Qian, JJ Go, Matthew Zhang

### Motivation

We want to build a website that can supplement the existing [CPSC 490 course website](https://dus.cs.yale.edu/490.html) and create a more engaging experience for students. This would help students brainstorm ideas for their own senior projects more easily and also showcase the hard work of previous students. If successful, it could ultimately replace the current course website. 

### Tech Stack

For this project, we used the following:

* Flask
* HTML, CSS, Javascript
* SQLite

### Run Application Locally

To run this application locally, run the command `python runserver.py <PORT>` from the `server` directory. In the command line output from running this command, there should be a line similar to the following:

``` * Running on https://<HOST>:<PORT>/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)```

Paste the link into your browser. It may warn you that the link is unsafe, but feel free to continue to the link anyways. You must be CAS authenticated to access the website.
